The existing file is 'test-cases/case4/src/mathOperations.ts'.

Perform the following modifications in 'test-cases/case4/src/mathOperations.ts':

1.  Modify the existing `add` function.
    - It should now accept a single argument: an array of numbers named `numbers` (type `number[]`).
    - It should return the sum of all numbers in the `numbers` array.
    - If the `numbers` array is empty, it should return 0.

2.  Add a new exported function named `multiply` to the same 'test-cases/case4/src/mathOperations.ts' file.
    - This function should take two arguments: `a` (type `number`) and `b` (type `number`).
    - It should return the product of `a` and `b`.
